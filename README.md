# Pixelating-Pollution

## Overview

Air pollution is one of the most important environmental threats to urban populations and while all people are exposed, pollutant emissions, levels of exposure, and population vulnerability vary across neighborhoods. Exposures to common air pollutants have been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and premature deaths. Getting a deeper look into pollution levels/ factors in California specifically could give an insight as to what people are being exposed to.
