						<p>Air pollution is one of the most important environmental threats to urban populations and
							while all
							people are exposed, pollutant emissions, levels of exposure, and population vulnerability
							vary
							across neighborhoods. Exposures to common air pollutants have been linked to respiratory and
							cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and premature deaths. Getting a deeper look into pollution
							levels/ factors in California specifically could give an insight as to what people are being
							exposed to.</p>

				<p>PM2.5 can evade our bodiesâ€™ defenses, penetrating deep into the lungs and even entering the bloodstream. 
					It has been shown to exacerbate asthma and other lung disorders, and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. 
					This microscopic pollution, named because each particle is smaller than 2.5 micrometers across, has also been 
					linked to developmental problems in children and cognitive impairment in the elderly, as well as premature labor 
					and low birth weights.<br>
					
				</p>

				<p>
					Climate change, and the hot, dry conditions it creates, has led to more catastrophic Western fires 
					and, with them, more air pollution. But fire hazards are also increasing because of greater development 
					in areas abutting wildlands, the over-suppression of natural wildfires, and aging electrical infrastructure.

					The map shows the distribution of AQI values in different counties of California.

					El Dorado and Lakes were two counties with the best AQI levels in 2023.</p>

					<h2>Fluctuating Air Quality as Summer Draws to a Close</h2>
				</header>
				<div id="linechart-container"></div>
				<p>Bay Area air quality has often taken a turn for the worse as the calendar flips from summer to fall,
					with spikes in particulate-matter pollution correlating closely with major wildfires.
					Over the past 10 years, Bay Area air quality has shown a trend of increasingly common spikes in
					pollution later in the summer,
					which come with increased health risks.
					Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution is shown in the line chart above.</p>

					<h2>How does AQI values vary in different parts of the Bay Area?</h2>
				</header>
				<div id="chart-container"></div>
				<p> Air is almost always on the move, and pollution can easily drift from one reporting zone to another. 
					This is particularly true in the Bay Area, which forms a single air basin, and where winds can blow pollution 
					from one location into neighboring valleys.In 2023, the Bay Area's Air Quality Index (AQI) revealed dynamic patterns 
					of pollution levels across its regions, showcasing areas with both high and low concentrations of pollutants.

				<p>For months, smoke from Canadian wildfires blanketed the U.S., causing the worst air quality on
					record.
					Is this the new normal? The chart visualizes daily Air Quality Index (AQI) values for PM 2.5 in the
					Bay Area,
					focusing on four major cities: San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland, and Fremont. It provides insights
					into ground-level ozone levels over the orange skies week in September 2023.</p>

								California Air Resources Board.</a> <br>CARB is charged with protecting the
