      <h3>Project Description:</h3>
      <p>Air pollution is one of the most important environmental threats to urban populations and while all
people are exposed, pollutant emissions, levels of exposure, and population vulnerability vary
across neighborhoods. Exposures to common air pollutants have been linked to respiratory and
cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and premature deaths. Getting a deeper look into pollution
levels/ factors in New York specifically could give an insight as to what people are being
exposed to.</p>
